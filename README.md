# Reading More Code

There is no game at the end this time. Just individual, unrelated functions to figure out for each challenge.

A total of ten challenges exist in the repo and will last through Thursday.

## Debugging and Testing is Key to the Part 02 Challenges

Use what you have learned

- tonight about reading code without running it
- last week about debugging
- in the past couple of weeks about writing tests

## Overview

Read all instructions in this README first.

We have four functions to read and determine what they do.

Each question branch as a new function named `nameThisFunction`.

You will rename the function in the branch. Then add the `index.js` file to staging, commit and push to your personal github repository.

## Get Ready to Work

Fork the repo to your personal github workspace.

Clone the repo to your local computer.

## Put in Work

Start by checking out the `challenge01` branch.

Read the code and make a best guess for function name.

Rename the function in the branch from `nameThisFunction` to a name you think best describes what the code in the function does.

Push your changes to the `challenge01` branch which you are on.

You will add, commit, and push all of your fixes to the challenge branches that you are on.
